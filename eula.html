                1. **End-User License Agreement Overview** <br>
                This document represents a binding legal agreement between you (the user) and POST Service & Consulting

                   - You are the owner or an authorized user of the device on which the NSP Software will be installed. <br>
                   - You confirm that you have the legal right and authority to enter into this agreement and to adhere
                to its terms and conditions as if you had physically signed it. <br>
                   - You must be at least 18 years old to use the NSP Software, unless you are between 13 (16 for EEA
                citizens) and 18 years old and have obtained your parent's or legal guardian's consent. In such cases,
                your parent or guardian should review and discuss this EULA with you, addressing any queries you might
                have, and install the NSP Software on your behalf.

                remaining provisions remain in effect. We encourage you to consult local regulatory bodies or legal
                advice to understand your rights fully.

                modification of browser settings, affecting various operating systems or web browsers. If you prefer not
                to have NSP Software installed on your device, do not agree to its installation or disable automatic
                updates to prevent further installations.
