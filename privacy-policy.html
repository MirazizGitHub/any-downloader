                RESPONSIBLE <br>
                Nexus Solutions PTE Ltd. 50 Scotts Road, W21 228242 WF Central Singapore <br>
                hello@nexus-solutions.com
                <br><br>
                Nexus Solutions PTE Ltd. (from here on referred to as "NSP", "we", "us", and "ours") aims to respect
                your privacy, whilst providing the best possible service. This policy will assist you in understanding
                the processing of personal data by NSP. This privacy policy applies to both the websites hosted by NSP
                and the software that NSP provides (from here on collectively referred to as “NSP Services”, and “our
                services”) The data processing that occurs through NSP is in accordance with the European Union's
                General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective May 25, 2018.
                <br><br>
                What Kind of Data Do We Collect and For What Purpose?
                We collect data you provide directly to us. For example, if you submit your email address to subscribe
                to our newsletter, we'll use that address to send the newsletter to you. Our collection and processing
                of usage data, such as service requests and actions taken while using our services, aim to deliver,
                optimize, and enhance the safety of our services. This includes analyzing crash reports and device
                information like your browser type, operating system, or language preferences. While your IP address is
                generally not permanently stored or is anonymized to minimize personal data collection, we use tools
                like Google Analytics and Facebook Marketing Services, under specific legal bases, to analyze web
                behavior and improve marketing efforts. Cookies, small text files placed on your device, help in
                personalizing and improving your experience on our site.
                <br><br>
                How Do We Handle Your Data?
                We share your personal information only when necessary to deliver our services or comply with legal
                obligations. This may include sharing data with service providers for service fulfillment, legal
                compliance, or safeguarding our rights and property. Our use of third-party services like Google
                Analytics, Facebook Pixel, and others, may involve transferring data outside the European Union to
                countries with varying data protection laws. We ensure these providers adhere to strict data protection
                and privacy standards.
                <br><br>
                Data Retention and Storage
                You have rights regarding your personal data, including access, amendment, or deletion requests.
                Generally, we retain personal data only for as long as necessary for processing, with certain exceptions
                like legal obligations or fraud prevention. Pseudonymized or anonymized data may be stored longer,
                without identifying you as an individual.
                <br><br>
                Your Rights Over Your Data
                You have control over your personal data, including rights to access, correct, delete, or withdraw from
                further processing. Uninstalling our software and services from your device ceases data transfer from
                your device. Should you decide to remove all NSP software products, each must be uninstalled separately.
                You also have the right to reach out to your local data protection authority for concerns.
                <br><br>
                Updates to Our Policy
                We may update this privacy policy periodically. Changes will be posted on our website, and we encourage
                you to review them. In events like mergers or asset sales, your data may be transferred, and we will
                notify you of such transfers whenever possible.
                <br><br>
                Contact Us
                For questions or concerns about our privacy practices or your data, please contact us or our data
                protection officer at hello@nexus-solutions.com.
